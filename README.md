# tank-trouble
An online multiplayer clone of the wonderful game tank trouble, using JavaScript and Python using only Flask and WebSocket as external libraries.
This is mostly a project for me to learn more JS and WebSocket, but it seems like we might actually get a playable game out of it...

I have shelved this project because my attention has been more focussed on other projects (for example [Wheatley](https://github.com/kneasle/wheatley), [Sapling](https://github.com/kneasle/sapling) and [Bellmetal](https://github.com/kneasle/bellmetal)).  Development is also extremely hard because WebSocket is **not** designed with real time games in mind, and so the game is likely to be extremely laggy and hard to play.
